# Data Analytics for Business Applications

 The traditional business applications, like CRM (Customer Relationship Management), ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), SCM (Supply Chain Management), marketing automation tools etc. capture and store vast amounts of information about customers, suppliers, products, and operations. Analyzing this data can drive insights that can inform strategic decision-making, help identify areas for improvement, and support the development of new products and services.

 This repository contains multiple end-to-end solutions on how the data from these business applications can be a part of a modern data warehouse or data lakehouse implementation.

## End to End Solutions

### Data Lakehouse - Dynamics 365 & Databricks

This architecture will outline how to implement a data lakehouse by ingesting data from dataverse, enriching the data, and generating insights and dashboards from it. Dataverse is the data platform that underlies Dynamics 365, as well as other Microsoft business applications such as Power Apps and Power BI.
